pyfunstream
===========

This module provide a simple mechanism to chain functions, only using
the operator overloading and a pair of classes


Features
========

- Functional programming with the pipe | operator.
- The stream stores the returned value by the last function.
- Partials.

Example of use
==============

```
    import funstream

    def sum2(a):
        return a + 2

    def mul3(a):
        return a*3

    fns = funstream.Stream()

    2 | fns[sum2] | fns[mul3] | fns[print]

    # The stream keeps the last value returned by the last function call

    fns = funstream.Stream() # Throw away the old stream

    2 | fns[lambda n: n*3]
    fns | fns[lambda n: n + 2]
    # fns.last_value == 8

    # Partials

    def mysum(a, b):
        return a + b

    def mymul(a, b):
        return a*b

    def addletter(letter, chain):
        return chain + letter

    s = funstream.Stream()
    value = 2 | s[(mysum, 2)] | s[(mymul, 2)] | s[str] | s[(addletter, 'a')] 
    # value == "8a"

```

TODO
====

- Incorpore mypy to the project, at least checkout.
- Store calls and its values through the stream (function call, value, return value).
